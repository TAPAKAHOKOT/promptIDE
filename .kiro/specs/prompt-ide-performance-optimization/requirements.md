# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the Prompt IDE application to eliminate typing lag and improve overall performance, particularly in the message editor component. The current application experiences significant performance issues when handling large prompts with multiple messages (15 prompts × 15 messages of ~1500 words each), causing noticeable input delay and UI freezing during typing operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Message Component Isolation

**User Story:** As a user typing in a message editor, I want only the message I'm editing to re-render, so that I don't experience lag when typing in one message while other messages remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in one message input THEN only that specific message component SHALL re-render
2. WHEN a user types in one message input THEN sibling message components SHALL NOT re-render
3. WHEN message content changes THEN the message list container SHALL NOT trigger a full re-render of all messages
4. IF a message's props haven't changed THEN the message component SHALL skip re-rendering using memoization

### Requirement 2: Optimized Input State Management

**User Story:** As a user typing long messages (1500+ words), I want the input to respond immediately to my keystrokes, so that I can type naturally without experiencing input delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in a message textarea THEN the input SHALL respond immediately without noticeable delay
2. WHEN a user types continuously THEN global state updates SHALL be deferred until typing pauses or field loses focus
3. WHEN a user stops typing for a defined period THEN local changes SHALL be synchronized to global state
4. WHEN a user clicks "Run" or switches prompts THEN any unsaved local changes SHALL be committed to global state
5. IF a message contains 1500+ words THEN typing performance SHALL remain smooth and responsive

### Requirement 3: Efficient List Rendering

**User Story:** As a user working with large prompt collections (15+ messages), I want the interface to render smoothly, so that scrolling and interactions don't become sluggish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying more than 10 messages THEN the system SHALL use virtualized rendering to show only visible items
2. WHEN drag-and-drop is enabled AND message count exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL either integrate virtualization with DnD or disable DnD for performance
3. WHEN scrolling through a large message list THEN only visible messages plus buffer SHALL be rendered in the DOM
4. IF virtualization is active THEN scrolling performance SHALL remain smooth regardless of total message count
5. WHEN reordering is needed for large lists THEN alternative reordering methods SHALL be provided if DnD is disabled

### Requirement 4: Optimized Auto-save Performance

**User Story:** As a user working on large prompts, I want my work to be automatically saved without interrupting my typing flow, so that I don't lose data while maintaining smooth performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pauses typing THEN auto-save SHALL trigger after an optimized debounce delay (1000ms+)
2. WHEN auto-save executes THEN it SHALL NOT cause noticeable UI freezing or input lag
3. WHEN the application unmounts or window closes THEN any unsaved changes SHALL be immediately persisted
4. IF prompt data is large THEN serialization SHALL be optimized to minimize performance impact
5. WHEN a user is actively typing THEN heavy save operations SHALL be deferred until idle state

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want to ensure performance optimizations are effective and measurable, so that the user experience remains consistently smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering calculations are performed THEN expensive computations SHALL be memoized appropriately
2. WHEN heavy libraries are needed THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded only when required
3. WHEN testing performance THEN optimizations SHALL be verified in production build environment
4. IF performance regressions occur THEN they SHALL be detectable through consistent measurement
5. WHEN handling maximum load (15×15 messages of 1500 words) THEN the application SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As an existing user of the Prompt IDE, I want all current functionality to remain available after performance optimizations, so that my workflow isn't disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are applied THEN all existing features SHALL continue to function as before
2. WHEN drag-and-drop is temporarily disabled for performance THEN users SHALL be notified and provided alternatives
3. WHEN local state management changes THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained across all user interactions
4. IF auto-save behavior changes THEN users SHALL not experience data loss under any circumstances
5. WHEN switching between prompts THEN all unsaved changes SHALL be properly handled and preserved
